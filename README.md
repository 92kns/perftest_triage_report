# Perftest Triage Report Generator

A Go CLI tool that automates the generation of weekly performance test triage reports by querying Bugzilla for:

- ðŸŸ§ Intermittent test failures with high orangefactor counts (>=20)
- ðŸŸ¥ Recent "Perma" bugs based on title substring
- Repository breakdown
- Assigned developer and NEEDINFO status
- Outputs a ready-to-copy HTML report

Useful for perftest triage sessions where engineers need a concise and accurate snapshot of the weekâ€™s flakiest or most problematic bugs.

---

## Current Features

- **Intermittent Bugs** (over threshold)
- **Perma Bugs** (identified by title)
- **OrangeFactor Graphs** (last 7 days)
- Platform + Repository breakdown parsing
- **Assigned To** and **NEEDINFO** tracking
- Generates `report.html`
- Daily report generated at 0900 UTC and published to pages

---

## Usage

### Run locally

```bash
go run main.go
```

Generates `report.html` and opens it in your browser.

### CLI flags

To compile a standalone binary:

```bash
go build -o bugzilla-report main.go
./bugzilla-report --no-open
```

## Output Example

See the latest published report here:

HTML includes:
- Intermittent bug summaries with repo and platform breakdowns
- Links to OrangeFactor graphs
- Perma bugs from last 7 days

## Future Ideas

- Trend reporting/detection via last 2-3 comments
- Archiving weekly reports in repo history
- Calls to treeherder database
- Breakdown by platform
